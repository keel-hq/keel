# Requirements: ARCHITECTURE.md Documentation

## User Stories

### US1: AI Agent Onboarding
As an AI agent working on this codebase, I want a comprehensive ARCHITECTURE.md file so that I can quickly understand the repository structure and locate relevant code without extensive exploration.

### US2: Quick Reference
As a developer or AI agent, I want key directories and their purposes clearly documented so that I can navigate directly to the right location for any given task.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Directory Map**: Document all top-level directories with one-line descriptions
2. **Core Concepts**: Explain the main abstractions (Providers, Triggers, Policies, etc.)
3. **Entry Points**: Identify where the application starts and how components connect
4. **Key Files**: List the most important files an agent should read first
5. **Data Flow**: Describe how events flow through the system (trigger → provider → deployment)
6. **Extension Points**: Document how to add new notification channels, triggers, or providers
7. **Configuration**: List key environment variables and annotations
